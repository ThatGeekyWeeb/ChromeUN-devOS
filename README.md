# ChromeUN-devOS
A guide to DEVOS (DEV MODE) on Older *Unsupported* Chromebooks!

## Unsupported?

With the release of ChromeOS 77.X many devices recived the *End Of Support* Notice!
![EndSupport](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssfgames13/ChromeUN-devOS/master/Screenshot%202020-04-29%20at%205.43.26%20PM.png)

### Broken Update?

Devices labeled as *unsupported* we're meant to recive ChromeOS 76.X as there final Update, but most didn't!\
While devices would be *prompted* ![Updatepromt]() to Update, the *Check For Update* button was removed, when devices we're labeled as *Unsupported*

> **Fixing?**

This update bug was never patched, but a work around was simple!
